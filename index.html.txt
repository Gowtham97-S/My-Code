Hi Gowtham: 
                                                         GIT USAGE:

1.Today i have learned github - git init, git config username and email, git add (file name), git branch -M(optional), 
  git remote add origin https(given in github profile - repository), git push -u origin(master/branch name).

2.New branch is created by git checkout -b "BranchName" (or) by git branch -M "BranchName"
    -> In you can type the new code in the old file itself but we have doubt if new branch is created or not.
    -> Confirm new branch is by git checkout master in comtprompt and changing into git checkout BranchName.

Example code:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
 <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
 <script type="text/javascript" src="index.js">
</head>
<body>
<h1>Gowtham business</h1>
</body>
</html>
